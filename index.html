    All things considered I’m satisfied with the course and I’m glad that I made the decision to enroll.  I’m very pleased with the instruction and with the TAs.  I do have two major problems with it however that prevent me from recommending the course in good conscience.  First, I’m still completely unsure how this program is affiliated with the University of Denver.  I assumed I was signing up for a program at DU and would have access to the resources on campus in addition to the online classes.  The page on the DU website strongly suggested this was the case.  My point of contact at the time of enrollment ghosted me as soon as I started asking questions about this.  I couldn’t get anyone to answer or call me back about this issue for a full two weeks before the class started.  I still have not yet received an answer to my question regarding who exactly my credentials will be issued by: DU or Trinity Education Services, whatever the latter is.  The second issue that I have is the intersection of the pace of the class and the complete lack of recourse if life circumstances interfere.  I’ve had two major family emergencies since I’ve enrolled in the class that have each dramatically reduced the amount of time I’m able to devote to studying and to completing homework assignments.  The first incident was that my wife and I, who also have a 4 month old child, have lost all our income and benefits.  The second was that our house has sustained severe water damage.  We’ve basically had to move out.  Our financial situation has become so dire that we’re going to have to move out, remodel and sell the house, and move to a state with a lower cost of living to recover.  After the second incident (which was a month into the course), I realized how my time would be impacted by both of these things.  I reached out to the program support manager to ask about deferring my enrolment to a later instance of the course.  The best she could come up with was that I could be changed to a non-participant status, forfeiting my credentials and career support upon completion.  If I was enrolled in a normal program and these kinds of things happened, I would be able to suspend my enrollment, take incompletes and make up the work within a reasonable amount of time.  In light of the pace of the material and the amount of time required, there needs to be some recourse in place to allow reasonable accommodations be made in such circumstances.  I take studying very seriously and wouldn’t have asked for such help if I didn’t need it.  I would tell people the following: Overall the course is a good experience so far, and that I’ve learned new skills which I greatly appreciate and look forward to developing further.  I’ve met some wonderful people with whom I’d like to stay in touch.  The instruction is excellent.  But there’s these other things that need to be fixed.  If the program needs to pretend to presented by a nationally ranked, major university, but is in fact affiliated only by leasing the name of this university, that’s something to be aware of and think about very carefully before you enroll.  If anything goes wrong while you are enrolled, you might as well consider the high price of the tuition gambling money.  If these two concerns were addressed I would be able to recommend the program without qualms.  As it stands I will have to tell people about the good and the bad so they can make the most informed decision possible.
